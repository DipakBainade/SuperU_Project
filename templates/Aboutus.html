    The education sector is evolving globally, cre- ating growth opportunities for the eLearning market.
    The sudden outbreak of coronavirus, which resulted in the closure of schools and colleges, has accelerated the
    requirement for alterna- tive online solutions to continue classroom sessions.
    This factor has encouraged companies to increase their R&D investments for launching innovative eLearning solutions to
    cater to the rising demand. Therefore, it can be said that the COVID-19 pandemic had a positive impact on the eLearning
    industry’s revenue. On the other hand,
    it is also true that the majority of eLearning platforms are charging very high amount of fees which many students are
    not able to afford it. Also, students from different streams have a different kinds of course requirements.<br>
    Shoppeal is a well-known digital startup firm found- ed in 2021 that provides students with career-relevant tech
    programs and companies with IT services at af- fordable prices. To cater to this growing demand, Shop- peal is focusing
